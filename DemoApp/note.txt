Important: The DemoApp tries to connect to the host machine, by using the address "10.0.2.2". But this will only work correctly, if the app is started 
inside an Android Virtual Device. Maybe it works, too, if the app is started on an Android Device, that is usb connected to a computer, but this is not
tested!

To create a debug build without Android Studio, but installed gradle, execute:
gradlew assembleDebug

To import the project into Android Studio:
File -> Open -> choose the build.gradle file in this folder
