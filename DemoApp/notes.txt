Important: The DemoApp tries to connect to the host machine, by using the address "10.0.2.2". But this will only work correctly, if the app is started 
inside an Android Virtual Device. Maybe it works, too, if the app is started on an Android Device, that is usb connected to a computer, but this is not
tested!

The Android Virtual Device has to use Android 8 and an x86 image.


To import the project into Android Studio:
File -> Open -> choose the build.gradle file in this folder
Then clean and rebuild the project.


To create a debug build without Android Studio, execute (gradle needn't to be installed): gradlew assembleDebug
Make sure that the Android sdk is in the path variable 'ANDROID_HOME' or you have created a file called local.properties in this folder with the following content:
ndk.dir=<Android-sdk-path>/ndk-bundle
sdk.dir=<Android-sdk-path>
